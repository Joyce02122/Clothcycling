# Clothcycling - Sustainable Clothing Decision Assistant

## Project objectives
This project aims to develop a sustainable clothing evaluation and recommendation system that helps users make informed decisions about clothing they no longer use or want. By using machine learning, the system will assess the condition of each item based on user-provided images and details, and offer personalized, eco-friendly suggestions—such as repairing, upcycling, donating, or recycling. The goal is to build an intuitive web platform where users can easily upload photos and input clothing information to receive tailored advice. Ultimately, the project promotes sustainable consumption and helps reduce textile waste by encouraging the reuse and responsible disposal of clothing.

## Target users and Their needs
1. General consumers: Have unwanted clothes at home and need a simple, trustworthy way to evaluate and decide what to do with them.
2. Eco-conscious individuals: Want to reduce waste and make sustainable choices by repairing, recycling, or upcycling old clothes.
3. DIY enthusiasts: Enjoy hands-on projects and seek creative ways to repurpose or transform unused clothing.

## Key Deliverables
**1. Web-based platform:** A user-friendly interface that allows users to upload clothing images or provide details about the item (material, age, condition, usage frequency, etc.). Displaying personalized recommendations for each item (repair, repurpose, sell, donate, or discard).
**2. Machine Learning Model:** A model trained to analyze images and item details to classify clothing based on material, condition, and other relevant attributes.  
**3. Value Assessment System:** A system that allows users to input their own value judgments on how much they are willing to invest in preserving or repairing the item, guiding the system's recommendations.  
**4. Recommendation Engine:** A system that generates actionable suggestions, such as repair methods, upcycling ideas, or nearby places to donate or sell the item, based on the analysis of the clothing and user input.

## Special Constraints
**1. Machine Learning Accuracy:** The accuracy of the machine learning model will be crucial for providing reliable recommendations. Since the model's effectiveness depends on the quality and quantity of the training data, it may be limited by the diversity and quality of available clothing samples.  
**2. Value Assessment Flexibility:** The user-defined value assessment system should be flexible, as different users may have varying perceptions of the worth of their clothing. The system should accommodate a wide range of user inputs without affecting the recommendations too drastically.

## Expected Outcome
**1. Clothing Analysis System:** Users will receive an evaluation report based on uploaded images and clothing details. This report will include an assessment of the item’s material, condition, and potential sustainability options. 
 
 **2. Interactive Decision Tool:** The platform will offer an intuitive interface where users can input their preferences, such as budget, repair efforts, or emotional attachment, guiding them to make personalized and informed decisions.  
**3. Actionable Recommendations:** The system will provide tailored suggestions, including options like repair, upcycling, donation, resale, or responsible disposal, based on the item’s condition and the user’s personal goals.  
**4. Feedback-Driven Optimization:** The system will use user interactions and feedback to continuously improve the machine learning model and recommendation engine, ensuring that recommendations become increasingly relevant and accurate over time.
